    Ensure On Sky Readiness.

    This script performs a sequence of checks and actions to ensure the
    telescope and associated systems are ready for on-sky operations.
    The main steps executed by this script are:

    1. Ensure that all MTCS and Camera components are enabled.
    2. Assert that the dome shutters are open.
    3. Ensure the M2 force balance system is enabled.
    4. Ensure MTM1M3 is raised at a safe elevation.
    5. Ensure the MTMount is homed.
    6. Ensure the M1M3 Force Balance System is enabled.
    7. Ensure M1M3 Slew Controller Flags are set as required.
    8. Ensure the M1M3 Mirror Covers are open.
    9. Ensure Camera Cable Wrap (CCW) following is enabled.
    10. Ensure Compensation Mode is enabled for both Hexapods.
    11. Ensure Dome Following Mode is enabled.
    12. Assert that the AOS (Active Optics System) Closed Loop is enabled.

    At each step, the script logs progress, checks system states, and takes
    corrective actions or raises warnings/errors as appropriate.

    Note: This script is not a complete end-to-end preparation for on-sky
    operations. It is a readiness check script that ensures the necessary
    systems are in place and configured correctly before/while any on-sky
    activities are performed.
